Two-way sort is a procedure for sorting an array of Boolean elements by maintaining a low cursor and a high cursor
and successively allowing these cursors to move towards each other by ensuring that everything to the left of the low
cursor is false and everything to the right of the high cursor is true.  The operation two_way_sort_rec is
defines the iteration with cursors i and j, and is invoked by two_way_sort with the proper initialization of the
cursors.  The correctness of the operation is captured in its type and the proof is embedded in the proofs of
the type-correctness conditions (TCCS).
