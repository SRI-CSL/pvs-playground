The directory contains a formalization of the fusion theorem [Richard Bird, Functional Algorithm Design, MPC'95]
as formalized in [N. Shankar, Steps Towards Mechanizing Program Transformations, Science of Computer Programming, 1995].
The formalization is an elegant illustration of the use of subtyping in PVS.  The unfold theory defines an operation
that recursively transforms data from an input type into a binary tree representation.  The
